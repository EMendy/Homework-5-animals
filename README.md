## Difficulties

I found this one to be very difficult. I don't easilly understand pandas, nor do I understand how it is at all like python.  It seems like you think this is a lot easier than using the VScode and pythin, but I don't see that this is as intuitive as you make it seem. 

## Questions

I am very confused about plots--specifically indices--, variables within pandas and how to call them or refernces them compared to the column and row heads, and groupby verse creating a variable.
